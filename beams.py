# beams.py
"""
Create BEAM elements as OpenSeesPy elasticBeamColumn members using the
**per-story / last section wins** behavior.

Definitions implemented:

1) Per-story:
   For each STORY S, if a BEAM line (from $ LINE CONNECTIVITIES) is assigned on S
   (via $ LINE ASSIGNS), we create exactly ONE beam element on story S that connects
   the two endpoints' nodes on S.

2) Last section wins (within a story):
   story_builder.py already condenses assigns so that for each (story, line) the
   FINAL record has the "winning" section. Here we *reassert* that behavior by
   re-deduping the per-story list (just in case) so the final occurrence per line
   in a story is the one used. If multiple entries appear for the same line within
   a story, the last one encountered in file order decides the section.

3) Node creation:
   Nodes should typically exist after define_nodes(). For robustness, this file
   can also create any missing node on demand using the coordinates in
   story_graph.json (active_points already carry x,y,z resolved with the new rule:
       Z = Z_story - d  (if the point has a third value d)
       Z = Z_story      (otherwise)
   ).

OpenSeesPy signatures (exact):
    geomTransf('Linear', 222, 0, 0, 1)
    element('elasticBeamColumn', tag, nI, nJ,
            A_beam, E_beam, G_beam, J_beam, Iy_beam, Iz_beam, 222)

Section properties here are placeholders; swap in real ones when you wire sections.
