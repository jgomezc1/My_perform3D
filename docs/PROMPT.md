\*\*Repo digest:\*\* https://gitingest.com/jgomezc1/My\_perform3D.git

\*\*Today’s goal:\*\* Verify that all the parts of the model have been built

\*\*Constraints:\*\* Python 3.11+, OpenSeesPy 3D/6DOF; phase-1 artifacts in `out/`; no heavy refactors unless asked.

\*\*Non-negotiables:\*\* small PRs; Conventional Commits; runnable diffs; explain “why” in PR description; keep docs updated.

\*\*Deliverables this session:\*\* <An explicit model file>



\*\*Files to read first from the digest\*\*  

\- `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, latest `docs/ADR/\*`  

\- `docs/TODO\_NEXT.md` (pick from top)  



\*\*Key anchors\*\*  

\- Build entry: `MODEL\_translator.build\_model(stage)` with stages `nodes|columns|all`.  

\- Phase-1: `e2k\_parser.py` → `story\_builder.py` → artifacts in `out/`.  

\- Domain parts: `nodes.py`, `diaphragms.py` (skip on DISCONNECTED or support stories), `supports.py` (ETABS RESTRAINT → `fix`), `columns.py`, `beams.py`.  

\- Viewer: `model\_viewer\_APP.py` reads OpenSees domain + `out/diaphragms.json` + `out/supports.json`.

1\) Read the digest docs above, then propose a 3-step plan for today.  

2\) When coding, return fully modified files.  

3\) If you need more files, ask for precise paths only.  

4\) Use Conventional Commits in suggestions.
